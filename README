                NPRQuake for Linux
	Jeremy Green (coolguywithgun@yahoo.com)

  This is a port of NPRQuake to Linux.  I have only tried it on my
machine.  It requires a GLX-compatible graphics card.  To compile,
simply run make from the NPRQuake directory.  Binaries will be placed
in the build subdirectory.  Simply copy (or link) the pak*.pak files
from your id1 subdirectory of your quake install into the build/id1
subdirectory, then run the quake shell script from the build
directory.  Once you have it running, you can type "r_load <renderer>"
from the console, where <renderer> is one of dr_default, sketch,
bprint, brush, and ainpr.  This release adds the ainpr renderer, which
has a cartoon style, and was created by Adrian Ilie (link to his site
is below).  Also new to this release is that it is no longer necessary
to add the ".so" extension to the renderer names.

NPRQuake was orignally made by the people at

and is a modification of Quake, by Id Software,

Mouse support and other fixes are from MFCN's GLQuake:

Number Six contribution:

- fix to allow compile under visual studio
- minor tweaks to load larger maps and models
- buffer fixes to prevent overflows
- updates from other sources

Can NOT get the linux version to load _any_ map - msg me if you can.
Win version works just great.
